 <p>I was born in 1976 in Izmir (Smyrna), Turkey.  After I graduated from high school, I enrolled to two years college, but I did not graduate from it.<br> My   goal was to learn English better at that time but I only took English as regular basic foreign language classes during my high school time . After high school, I wanted to learn English <br>and enroll a college with English major But I was not allowed to enroll in any colleges for English majors because of the Turkish higher education system and my college entrance exam scores.<br> I always looked where I
 could learn English better and get a degree in English. I had the opportunity and I went to
 the Philippines as a tourist in 1998 where English is an official language. <br>The
 Philippines were an inexpensive country to live and get an education. I decided to stay in the Philippines and get my higher education. Finally, my dream
 came through, <br> I was twenty-two years old and started fresh for my college education in
 English major. Although, I struggled a lot in my first year as an ESL student because all
 the classes that I had to take were in English, like math, philosophy, economics etc. And I
 was almost 7000 miles away from my home country in a totally different culture to adapt.
 But I did not give up, worked hard and attended lots of tutoring after my classes. All things
 I had been through were for my English and my education. Upon my graduation, I always
 sought other opportunities to lift my English level more and more. While I work as ESL teacher in Turkey, I have been granted to
 attend two English and educational workshops in Ireland and Sweden by the Socrates
 Program which is an educational initiative of the European Union Commission. However,
 I worked different area in the schools, I always wanted to focus on and work on English
 and linguistic field. It is my life goal. Then I started my master in the US. I recently
 finished my Master in ESL and Bilingual Education last March 2018 which took almost
 two and a half years.

    In my life, I always challenged myself. For the last 2 years, I was observing the software and coding bootcamps. A couple of my colleagues quitted their job and attended one of those bootcamps and finished their courses with finding new career and job.  Some people say “it is too risky to quit jobs’, but I do not hesitate to take the risk in my life. Where I am now is the results of those risk that I took in the past.  I quit my decent job to attend Coding Bootcamp. I successfully completed my intensive course within 16 weeks in June 2019. Now, I am ready for my new journey!
